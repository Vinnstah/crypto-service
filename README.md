[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Vinnstah/crypto-service/graph/badge.svg?token=YZ6OR1BZXJ)](https://codecov.io/gh/Vinnstah/crypto-service)

A Crypto REST API-backend written in Rust with Axum. 

# Background
This project came to life from wanting to develop a API-backend in Rust. 

# How do I use it?
The project can be run locally after add a `.env` with the API-keys or in the cloud by containerizing it.
There is also the option to bundle the binary directly in your iOS-app by using uniFFI generated bindings (WIP).
